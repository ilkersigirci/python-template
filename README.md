# Project Structure

- It uses `project.toml` instead of `setup.py` and `setup.cfg`. The reasoning is following:
- As [official setuptools guide](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/main/docs/userguide/quickstart.rst) says, " configuring new projects via setup.py is discouraged"
- One of the biggest problems with setuptools is that the use of an executable file (i.e. the setup.py) cannot be executed without knowing its dependencies. And there is really no way to know what these dependencies are unless you actually execute the file that contains the information related to package dependencies.
- The pyproject.toml file is supposed to solve the build-tool dependency chicken and egg problem since pip itself can read pyproject.yoml along with the version of setuptools or wheel the project requires.
- The pyproject.toml file was introduced in PEP-518 (2016) as a way of separating configuration of the build system from a specific, optional library (setuptools) and also enabling setuptools to install itself without already being installed. Subsequently PEP-621 (2020) introduces the idea that the pyproject.toml file be used for wider project configuration and PEP-660 (2021) proposes finally doing away with the need for setup.py for editable installation using pip.
- It uses [entry points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html)

# Install

## Default installation
- Install poetry
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

- Install the project dependencies
```bash
conda create -n python-template python=3.8 -y
conda activate python-template
make install
```

- After running above command, the project installed in editable mode with all development and test dependencies installed.
- Moreover, a dummy `entry point` called `placeholder` will be available as a cli command.

## Docker

```bash
# Development build (800 MB)
docker build --tag python-template --file docker/Dockerfile --target development .

# Production build (145 MB)
docker build --tag python-template --file docker/Dockerfile --target production .
```

- To run command inside the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it python-template:latest bash

# Temporary container
docker run -it python-template:latest bash
```
